# Learning Log

## Week 1 Day 1 (Fri Oct 2, finished Sat Oct 3): Claude Code basics

**Learn:** How Claude Code works: CLAUDE.md memory, plan mode, /clear vs /compact, reviewing diffs.
Check questions: 4 / 6.
- CLAUDE.md loads from the launch folder **and every parent folder** (both my portfolio and AI Learning files load). Child-folder CLAUDE.md files load only when Claude works there.
- Plan mode is read-only: use it for multi-step, multi-file or unclear tasks; skip it for small obvious edits. Planning costs tokens up front but is cheaper than rework.
- `/clear` wipes context (use between unrelated tasks); `/compact` summarizes it (use when a long session is still on the same task). Every message resends the whole conversation, so stale context burns Pro quota.

**Build:**
- Created public GitHub repo `dilips24/ai-builder-portfolio` and pushed the initial commit.
- Used Claude Code (Sonnet, plan mode) to write `day01/token_estimator.py`: 8 synthetic change-request questions, chars/4 token estimate, Haiku input cost.
- Committed and pushed myself: `Day 1: token estimator script`.

**Numbers:** 8 questions, 339 chars, ~89 estimated tokens, ~$0.000089 estimated Haiku input cost (at $1.00 per million input tokens).

**What broke and how I fixed it:**
- PowerShell would not run `Activate.ps1` by name. Fix: allow local scripts once (`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`), then run scripts with a path (`.\Activate.ps1`, or `..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` from the portfolio folder). PowerShell never runs scripts from the current folder without `.\`.

**Next:** Day 2 compares this chars/4 estimate with the real token counts the API returns.
